# PropertyPlanner

## Real estate properties not all the same? Not a problem.

The objective of PropertyPlanner was for me to practice the concepts of inheritance, enums and abstract classes in Java. In this assignment, I write a series of classes to construct an application for a real-estate firm. There are 9 classes: Property, House, Land, MultiUnitBuilding, Cottage, Farm, Office, Apartment Building and a BadProperty exception class.
